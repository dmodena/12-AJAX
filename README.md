12-AJAX
========
Last assignment for term 3 of the BIT course at Red River College. In order to check the output and functionality, please open the html file in the **public** folder.

For this assignment I decided to use [CoffeScript](http://coffescript.org) instead of regular JavaScript. Some ruby gems were installed in order to auto generate the output as I was saving while working on the assignment.

Dependencies
------------
The gems used for this assignment are listed in the **Gemfile**. Only three main 4 main gems were used (the other are only dependencies of the main gems). They are:
- [Haml](http://haml.info) - Used for markup generation;
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) - Used for CSS generation;
- [CoffeeScript](http://coffescript.com) - Used for JavaScript generation;
- [Guard](http://guardgem.org) - Used for automating the compilation process.
